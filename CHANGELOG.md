All notable changes to the "Ansible Lint Helper" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-06

### New Features

#### 🔀 Error Sorting by Severity
- Errors are now **always sorted by severity**:
  - ❌ **ERRORS** (red section) — shown first
  - ⚠️ **WARNINGS** (orange section) — shown second
  - ℹ️ **INFO** (blue section) — shown last
- Each section has a colored header with count
- Within each section, errors are sorted by file and line number

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-06

### New Features

#### 📦 Smart Caching
- **File content caching** - results are cached based on file hash (MD5)
- **Skips unchanged files** - if file wasn't modified, uses cached results
- **"Using cached results"** notification when cache is used
- **Clear Cache** command to force re-check all files
- **Cache auto-invalidation** after Fix operations

#### ⚙️ GUI Settings
- **Settings button (⚙️)** in the panel - opens VSCode settings filtered to ansible-lint
- New configurable options:
  - `ansible-lint.useCache` (default: true) - enable/disable caching
  - `ansible-lint.lineLength` (default: 150) - max line length for yamllint
  - `ansible-lint.indentSpaces` (default: 2) - indentation spaces (2 or 4)
- Settings are applied automatically when no workspace config exists
- Workspace config files (`.yamllint`, `.ansible-lint`) take priority over VSCode settings

#### 🛠️ New Commands
- `Ansible Lint: Clear Cache` - clear all cached linting results
- `Ansible Lint: Open Settings` - quick access to extension settings

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-06

### New Features

#### 🚫 Ignore Rule Support
- **Ignore button** on each error - adds rule to appropriate config file
  - `[yamllint]` errors → added to `.yamllint` as `rule: disable`
  - `[ansible-lint]` errors → added to `.ansible-lint` skip_list
  - `[pre-commit]` errors → shows manual edit instructions
- **Smart re-check** after Ignore:
  - If last check was "Check File" → re-runs Check File
  - If last check was "Check All" → re-runs Check All

#### ⚙️ Linter Toggle Settings
- New settings to enable/disable individual linters:
  - `ansible-lint.enableYamllint` (default: true)
  - `ansible-lint.enablePreCommit` (default: true)
  - `ansible-lint.enableAnsibleLint` (default: true)

#### 📁 Collapsible File Groups
- When using "Check All", errors are grouped by file
- Click on file header (▼/►) to collapse/expand errors
- Shows error count per file

#### 🎛️ UI Improvements
- Renamed buttons: "Run" → "Check File", removed "Clear", added "Fix File"
- Button order: `Check File` | `Check All` | `Fix File` | `Fix All`
- More compact error display (removed explicit severity badges)
- Russian detailed explanations for all rules (yamllint, ansible-lint, pre-commit)

#### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- Fixed pre-commit path duplication issue (test_extension/test_extension/...)
- Fixed Ignore not working for yamllint rules (was adding to wrong config)
- Improved error parsing for all linter output formats
